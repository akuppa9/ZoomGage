# Revolutionize Meetings with ZoomGage: AI-Powered Engagement on Autopilot

## ZoomGage is a remote engagament-boosting tool that leverages computer vision to assess real-time engagement of meeting participants with a 99.7% accuracy. Two models, YOLO and MediaPipe, were fine-tuned to detect levels of drowsiness, facial landmark position, and if a user was yawning. These metrics were weighted to develop a cohesive engagement score, which is calculated by frame of video and sent to the meeting host. The engagement score is averaged amongst all participants, so hosts cannot single out individual participants, but can rather use this score as an indication of how engaging their meetings are.

## Unveiling the Secrets of Engagement:

### Drowsiness Detection: 

ZoomGage's YOLO model, fine-tuned for this specific purpose, identifies signs of drowsiness, ensuring everyone stays sharp and on point.

### Attention Tracking: 

Mediapipe, a powerful machine learning tool, goes beyond drowsiness. It monitors facial landmarks to determine if participants are looking away from the screen or yawning, providing valuable insights into overall focus.

## Engagement Made Measurable:

### Real-Time Engagement Score: 

ZoomGage transforms qualitative data into a quantitative metric. A weighted engagement score is displayed in real time, offering meeting hosts a clear understanding of participant focus.

### Actionable Insights: 

With this data, hosts can make informed decisions to keep meetings dynamic and participants actively involved.

### Boost Participation, Enhance Outcomes:

ZoomGage goes beyond simply measuring engagement. It empowers hosts to foster a more interactive environment, ultimately leading to more productive and successful meetings.
